                <p>Developed an offline fire unit recommendations engine in Python which decreased

                <p>Developed a Python application to match new employees in training with appropriate 
                    trainers based on their schedule, experience, and personality style.
                </p>
                <p>Implemented a new data-driven training model to provide better insight into new 
                    employee's progress through the training program. Implemented dashboards in PowerBI 
                    to allow other dispatch supervisors and managers to monitor trainee progress more 
                    easily.</p>
                <p>Worked with external developers to scope then test a new offline dispatch product.

                    release stages.</p>
